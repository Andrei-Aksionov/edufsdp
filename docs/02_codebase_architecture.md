<br>

The `edufsdp` codebase is structured to maintain a direct, transparent correspondence between theoretical distributed principles and actual implementation details. Rather than relying on complex production wrappers or heavy C++ extensions, the architecture uses standard Python and PyTorch primitives to expose the mechanics of parameter sharding, lifecycle hooks, and state management.

The core logic is partitioned into four primary modules:

* **sharded_parameter.py** — Manages local weight slices, global shape abstractions, and state transitions.
* **hooks.py** — Implements the custom autograd communication function and lifecycle hooks.
* **fsdp.py** — Orchestrates recursive module wrapping and hook registration.
* **state_dict.py** — Handles checkpoint conversion between local shards and full global tensors.

## 1. Explicit Parameter Management

The foundational building block of the library is the ShardedParameter class (`sharded_parameter.py`). In a sharded environment, each rank only owns a fraction of any given parameter tensor.

* **Local vs. Global Representation:** ShardedParameter wraps the local weight slice residing on the current rank while keeping track of the tensor's global shape and sharding dimension via PyTorch's native DTensor abstractions.
* **State Manipulation Methods:** ShardedParameter exposes two key state manipulation methods that control whether a module sees its local shard or the fully gathered weight:
  * *set_unsharded(full_tensor)*: Mounts the gathered full parameter tensor directly onto the module's attribute dictionary (module.\_\_dict\_\_), allowing normal forward/backward matrix multiplication.
  * *set_sharded()*: Restores the attribute pointer back to the sharded DTensor and clears the cached full tensor reference (_gathered_tensor = None), freeing memory immediately.

## 2. Custom Autograd & Lifecycle Hooks

Distributed training requires precise synchronization timed directly to the execution of the forward and backward passes. The `hooks.py` module manages this timing through a native autograd integration and discrete hook classes.

### Custom Autograd Function

`FSDPAllGatherFunction` inherits from `torch.autograd.Function`, integrating distributed communication natively into PyTorch's autograd graph:

* **Forward Pass:** Takes the local shard, reconstructs a sharded DTensor, and redistributes it to 'Replicate()' placement across all ranks via the Gloo backend. This yields the full un-sharded tensor across all ranks.
* **Backward Pass:** Intercepts incoming gradients, wraps them in a Partial DTensor, and redistributes them via 'redistribute(\[Shard(dim=0)\])'. It then normalizes the sharded gradient by dividing by the world size ($N$), completing the Reduce-Scatter operation.

### Lifecycle Hooks

Four discrete hook classes manage parameter lifecycles by leveraging the parameter state methods:

* **Forward Pre-Hook**: Intercepts module execution before the forward pass begins, triggering the All-Gather collective via 'FSDPAllGatherFunction.apply()' to temporarily reconstruct the full parameter tensor from local shards.
* **Forward Post-Hook**: Executes immediately after the forward computation finishes, discarding the gathered full parameter tensor to reclaim peak device memory.
* **Backward Pre-Hook**: Coordinates the secondary All-Gather required during the backward pass to restore parameter weights before gradient calculation.
* **Backward Post-Hook**: Executes immediately after the backward pass computation finishes, specifically responsible for dropping and cleaning up the temporary all-gathered weights.

<br>

## 3. FSDP Orchestration Class

The FSDP wrapper class (`fsdp.py`) acts as the primary user-facing interface for wrapping standard PyTorch models.

* **Recursive Module Traversal:** When a model is passed to FSDP, the wrapper inspects its submodules and parameters recursively.
* **Parameter Wrapping:** Standard 'torch.nn.Parameter' instances are converted into managed 'ShardedParameter' objects.
* **Hook Registration:** It automatically binds the appropriate forward and backward hooks from `hooks.py` to each wrapped module, ensuring that communication collectives occur transparently during training execution.

## 4. State Dictionary Manager

Saving and loading checkpoints in a distributed sharded environment requires handling two distinct operational modes, managed by StateDictManager (`state_dict.py`):

* **Local Mode** (*StateDictType.Local*)
  * Get State Dict: Extracts rank-specific DTensor shards directly from each process with zero inter-process communication.
  * Load State Dict: Copies rank-local tensor payloads directly into 'parameter.local_shard'.
* **Full Mode** (*StateDictType.Full*)
  * Get State Dict: Automatically gathers full un-sharded parameter tensors across ranks using FSDPAllGatherFunction, returning a unified global state dictionary suitable for single-device inference or export.
  * Load State Dict: Takes a global un-sharded checkpoint, distributes tensors across ranks using distribute_tensor with 'Shard(dim=0)', and loads local shards accordingly.
